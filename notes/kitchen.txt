House was built in 1898. Kitchen is 13.9' x 14.5'. There are four doorways into the kitchen: a back porch door, a back hallway, a door to the front hall, and a door to the dining room. We're not planning to relocate the existing sink. We've figured out a general layout that maximizes countertop and cabinet storage space while avoiding significant structural changes, but there's room for design finessing. 
 
The kitchen floor is multiple layers of original floor, 30's linoleum, 1/8th plywood, 80s-era vinyl tile, 1/8th plywood, and 00's-era stick-on floors. Task #1: remove all the flooring layers and replace with a solid subfloor, followed by probably either LVT or cork. 

Ceiling was originally 10'. Later it was lowered to 8', with a soffit along one wall. There's also an odd vertical soffit-like bump-out. Task #2: restore the original height, with horizontal & vertical soffits removed. 

The room's only light is a central chandelier controlled from the front hall door and the back door. Task #3: in the island, a new 220 line for the cooktop and two 120 outlets for appliances. Task #4: additional can lighting and separately-controlled pendant lighting over the new island -- with sufficient 3-way or 4-way controls so no more walking through a dark room to get to a switch. Task #5: two sets of task lighting under the wall cabinets, controlled at point of use.
