<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the picturesque valley of the 
Monongahela River, just six miles from the "Golden Triangle" of 
Pittsburgh, is situated the borough of West Homestead.  It is not very 
large, but what it lacks in size is made up in its industries and 
wealth, for today it is one of the richest boroughs in the state of 
Pennsylvania.  Let us look back over the history of this thriving, 
industrious community.  The first inhabitants of this region were the 
Tallegewi, an Indian tribe.  Our knowledge of them is very vague, but we
 do know the that they were conquered by the Delawares who came from the
 West.  Before the advent of the white man, savage warfare had wrested 
the supremacy from them and bestowed it upon the indomitable Iroquois, 
who laid claim to all of Western Pennsylvania.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The French claimed by right of discovery 
all the lands drained by the Mississippi and its tributaries.  They 
fixed the limits of their possessions at the summit of the Allegheny 
Mountains.  The English claimed the same region, and in 1607 gave it to a
 group of settlers to make the colony of Virginia.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 4, 1681, it was included in the charter which the English king granted to William Penn.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The French and Indian War settled the 
question of ownership of this region in favor of the English.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By 1754 a few white settlers had built 
cabins west of the Allegheny Mountains.  More and more kept coming, and 
the Indians resented this.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indian attacks were common along the 
frontier and the fighting was severe, yet the settlers continued to take
 up lands west of the mountains.  The Indians complained of the 
encroachment to the English king, and to the govenors of Pennsylvania 
and Virginia.  on October 7, 1763, King George forbade any settlements 
west of the Alleghenies.  Two years later, 1765, King George again 
warned John Penn, Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania, to allow no new 
settlers in this part of the state, and to see that those who were here 
were evacuated immediately.  At that time Western Pennsylvania was 
claimed by both Pennsylvania and Virginia, but our General Assembly and 
the Governor of Virginia agreed that the land west of the mountains 
belonged to the Indians.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the white men continued to come.  
Those already settled in this region refused to relinquish their lands 
and leave them in possession of the natives whom they hated, and from 
whom they had suffered much.  Under these circumstances but one course 
could be persued; the title to the country must be purchased from the 
Indians.  Accordingly, on the 24th day of October, 1768, a council was 
held with the Iroquois at Fort Stanwix, now Rome, New York.  A treaty 
was made November 5, 1768, and the Indians agreed to give up their title
 of Western Pennsylvania.  This was the last treaty which Pennsylvania 
had with the natives.  The last extensive acquisition was long known as 
the "New Purchase," and at that time it was all included in Westmoreland
 Country.  The was was now clear for the march of civilization to the 
Allegheny and the Ohio Valleys.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The title thus being acquired, measures 
were immediately taken to prepare the newly purchased lands for sale.  
On April 3, 1769, the lands in the New Purchase were sold at five pounds
 sterling per hundred acres.  This was equivalent to about 25 dollars.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A few years later a petition was presented
 to the Assembly of Pennsylvania asking for the erection of a new county
 out of the territory around the head of the ohio, the principle reasons
 being the increase in population, and the difficulty of having to 
travel so far in quest of justice.  The county seat then was in 
Greensburg, Pennsylvania.  The petition was favorably received, and an 
act was passed September24, 1788, erecting the county of Allegheny, but a
 much larger Allegheny than the one with which the readers of this 
history are familiar.  The name "Allegheny" was derived from a tribe of 
Indians called the Alleghans, which occupied the land along the 
Allegheny River in ancient times.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The division of the county into townships 
for the better governing of the increasing population was a matter of 
the first importance, and early engaged the attention of the court.  On 
the 18th of December, 1788, the court divided Allegheny County into the 
following townships: Moon, St. Clair, Mifflin, Elizabeth, Versailles, 
Plum, and Pitt.  For the purpose of this history we shall deal with the 
Mifflin Township, because in the early days the region now known as West
 Homesteadwas a part of that township.  It was named for Thomas Mifflin,
 Governor of Pennsylvania at the time of its formation.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very little is known about the court 
records in this vicinity.  According to the court records John Travis 
owned a large tract of land where West homestead is now, and had it 
surveyed July 10, 1769.  He deeded it to Richard Butler and William 
Butler December 4, 1773.  Richard Butler released his right to William 
Butler by a patent dated January 25, 1788.  The consideration was 36 
pounds, five shillings, six pence or about $175.  This Butler tract was 
called "Southerland," and it extended from the Monongahela River to 
Doyle Avenue, and from a line west of Streets Run to Victor Alley.  
William Butler had been a colonel in command of the Fourth Pennsylvania 
Regiment of the American Army during the Revolutionary War.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the early settlers in Mifflin 
Township was David Calhoun, a man of Scotch-Irish ancestry, who came 
from Lancaster, Pa.  When he was 18 years of age, David enlisted in the 
Continental Army.  He saw continuous service throughout the 
Revolutionary War; he was wounded in the Battle of Brandywine, but 
reenlisted, and finally saw Cornwallis deliver up his sword after the 
siege of Yorktown.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the war David and a certain John 
Shearer, of whom nothing further is known, applied for a government land
 grant.  Those grants were issued to Revolutionary Soldiers upon payment
 by the soldiers of one dollar per acre of soft land.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1789 such a grant was issued on 
sheepskin by the newly constituted government of the United States, and 
it was known as the Calhoun-Shearer Patent.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Calhoun heirs have no definite 
knowledge of the original acreage, but this considerably more extensive 
than that later annexed to the borough.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first house on the Calhoun Estate was a
 log cabin, located somewhere on the site of the present New Homestead; 
it was built by David Calhoun.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second house, also built by David, was
 a stone inn or "hostelry" located somewhere along the present West Run 
Road.  This was known as the "Hunters' Rest."  Its location was along 
the first road constructed between Pittsburgh and the boat-building town
 of Elizabeth, Pennsylvania.  It became the established overnight stop 
between the two towns.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;David's son, David K. Calhoun, built the 
third house.  It was made of stone, and was still standing when the 
United States Housing Authority Project was instituted.  It was razed by
 the Housing Authority.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fourth house on this estate, built in 
1816, still stands within the limits of the Borough of West Homestead.  
It was constructed of hand made bricks fired at a kiln in the adjoining 
fields, and framed with hand-hewn timbers throughout.  It is undoubedly 
one of the oldest houses in the entire district.  It is located near the
 intersection of Orchard Street and Calhoun Lane, and at the present 
time is occupied by Mr. and Mrs. Ross Varner.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an Indian legend which was 
accepted by the old settlers, that a vein of silver exists on the 
Calhoun Estate.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An old Indian used to return to this 
section every year, and obtained silver bullion which he had minted 
annually.  When the first wells were dug on the site of Homestead Park, 
now Munhall, traces of silver were found in the water analyses.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Calhoun tract was annexed to the 
Borough of West Homestead considerably later than the formation of the 
borough itself.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A section of the original tract was sold recently, and it is known as Calhoun Manor.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Calhoun heirs still retain approximately 100 acres of the original grant.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large brick house of David K. Calhoun,
 built in 1874, was located on Eighth Avenue, at the end of the Calhoun 
tract.  It was on the site of the present Calhoun Junior High Shcool .
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another prominent settler in this district
 was James H. Hays, who owned a large tract of land within the present 
boundaries of West Homestead.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1828 he began mining coal at the mouth 
of Street's Run, the present location of hays Station.  Mr. Hays was a 
native of Mifflin Township, of Scotch and French extraction.  He taught 
school and worked at the trade of copper until 28 years of age, when he 
embarked in the coal trade, in which he was one of the pioneers.  His 
death occured in March, 1876.  The good fortune which attended Mr. Hays 
in all his transactions, was a consequence of untiring industry, good 
management of his interests, and above all, of a firm, uncompromising 
spirit of personal honor and integrity.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His name was always a synonym for excellent judgement and sterling honesty.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first houses, built within the limits 
of the original borough, were built on Doyle Avenue between 1871 and 
1873, by the contracting firm of William Waite and William Rowlands. 
Most of them were men who were officials in the various glass companies 
located in South Side of Pittsburgh.  There were eight of these original
 homes.  They were owned by:
<br></p><center>
William Beck&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William Waite
<br>
Charles K. Bryce&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Farley
<br>
William Stimley&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William Rowlands
<br>
James McRoberts&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joseph Doyle
</center>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The street was named Mr. Doyle.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;William Beazell, a druggist in Homestead, 
built the first house after the lots were laid out in the borough.  It 
is now occupied by John Dixon, and stands on Ninth Avenue near Hays 
Street.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first pre-borough school was located 
on West Run Road, on land donated for that purpose by David K. Calhoun.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the year of 1900 there were 208 houses 
in what is now West Homestead, and the population was between 1200 and 
1500.  The section between West Run and Homestead was generally called 
West Homestead, and on the other side of West Run the village went by 
the name of Forrestville.  Both villages were in Mifflin Township.  
Living conditions in them were not pleasant because there were no paved 
streets or sidewalks, except for a few board walks here and there.  
There was no sewage, and no police or fire protection.  The only street 
lights were along 8th Avenue, and they were far apart.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June 23, 1900, the citizens of  West 
Homestead and Forrestville presented a petition to the Court of Quarter 
Sessions of Allegheny County, asking for the incorporation of the two 
villages into the borough of West Homestead.  The petition was signed by
 73 freeholders.  The men who were witnessed for the petitioners were C.
 A. Sweadner, J. N. Dean, John R. Ackerman, R. L. Smith and Edward Bell.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mifflin Township protested the loss of these villages, but their protests were overruled.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The petition was approved by Judge Shafer 
on December 9, 1900.  He granted a charter for the incorporation of the 
community as a borough, and it was recorded January 29, 1901.  The court
 also set February 19, 1901, for a special election of borough 
officials.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to prepare for the special 
election a town meeting was called for the evening of January 16, 1901. 
 The citizens met in the town's four-roomed schoolhouse on Walnut 
Street.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first election there were no party
 lines drawn, but "politicking" for office was intense.  Ballots 
contained the names of 65 candidates.  Some of the first elected 
officials were:
<br><center>
Edward Ball&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Burgess
<br>
W. J. Turner&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borough Secretary
<br>
D. W. Laird&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chief of Police
<br>
Joseph Garver&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Street Commissioner
<br>
C. A. Sweadner&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tax Collector
<br>
F. L. Rose&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superintendant of Schools
<br>
H. D. Trautman&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President of Council
<br>
A. F. Leuschner&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;President of the School Board
</center>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first meeting of the council was held 
on March 4, 1901, in the school house, the center of community activity 
at that time.  Present in addition to H. D. Trautman, were R. J. Garver,
 A. Topper, L. H. Jennings, C. P. Laird, C. J. Mesta and J. E. Roberts.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the first several formative year 
all borough officials were quite busy providing for the welfare of the 
community.  Council had to solve the questions of street and boardwalk 
improvements, new sewers, a water supply, the purchase of an appropriate
 lot on which a borough building could be constructed, a right-of-way to
 a street railway company eventually giving transportation to all 
surrounding communities, and providing street paving improvements.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Municipal Building was erected in 1901 at the corner of 8th Avenue and Howard Street.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same year the school house was 
completely destroyed by fire.  The school board had to face the 
provision of new text books and other equipment, and temporary 
headquarters until a new buff brick building of eight rooms could be 
opened in 1903.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On May 7, 1901 the borough council fixed the salaries of borough employees as follows:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;$50 per year for Secretaries and 
Patrolmen.  Street Commissioners made $3 per day, additional labor on 
the streets made $1.75 per day, and Solicitor made $300 per year.
<br>
By June, 1901, various individuals and companies had bought sections of 
land in West Homestead and laid out lots.  They were known as:
<br><center>
Kennedy and West Plan
<br>
Henry A. West Plan
<br>
Homestead Extension Plant
<br>
Homestead and Howard Plan
<br>
David K. Calhoun Plan
</center>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first man to establish a meeting in 
West Homestead was Al Leuschner, who had a wagon shop at the corner of 
Seventh Avenue and Hays Street.  There he built and repaired wagons and 
buggies, and made his own wheels.  He did a flourishing business, for 
travel in those days was done mostly by wagons and buggies.  He made the
 bed for the first automobile in the Homestead Area, for Dr. Doyle, and 
it caused great interest and excitement.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first store in West Homestead was 
located at the corner of Eighth Avenue and Hays Street.  It was operated
 by R. J. Garver who sold groceries and produce.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second store was J. N. Dean's Grocery Store at 247 Eighth Avenue.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charles Greiner opened the first plumbing shop at 236 Eighth Avenue.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our first drug store was opened by W. J. 
Turner, who was also the first borough secretary, at 249 Eighth Avenue. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before West Homestead became a borough the
 post office was a corner in Turner's Drug Store, where people had to go
 and ask for their mail.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the town meeting held on January 16, 
1901, an announcemnet was made that free delivery of mail would be 
extended to the borough from the Homestead Post Office.  However, it 
wasn't until the end of the year that Framk B. Painter was appointed as 
the first West Homestead carrier.  He had a difficult time at first on 
his long route, because many of the horses were not numbered yet.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Few epidemics in West Homestead's history 
have caused so much excitement, and hit the headlines with such 
consistancy as the small-pox scare, which prevailed here through the 
months of March and April in the year 1902.  The frst patients were 
cared for in their own homes which were placed under strict quarantine. 
 As the number of victims increased, a building on the Calhoun Farm was 
fitted up as a temporary hospital or "pest house."  About 35 or 40 
patients were cared for, and only a few died.  The same building is now 
used as the Boy Scout Lodge in Camp Calhoun.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the epidemic the local school board
 wanted to make sure that all West Homestead pupils were vaccinated.  So
 they hired Dr. Sawyer, a Pittsburgh physician, to do the work.  The 
Board of health received commendation for its good work in handling the 
situation, and for confining the epidemic to a small area.
